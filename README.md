# Mark Ball Portfolio website - T1A3

Portfolio website: TBC

Github: https://github.com/Mark-Ball/portfolio-site

# Purpose

The purpose of the portfolio website is to present my skills, interests, and work history to potential employers and collaborators. This will enhance my visibility to others in the technology industry, which will assist in gaining employment or becoming involved with interesting projects.

As a developer, the website itself functions as an exhibition of software development and design capabilities. Therefore extra attention has been paid to designs which address modern concerns. These concerns include responsiveness to screens of different sizes, interactivity to encourage visitors to return to the site, and accessibility for the visually impaired.

# Functionality and Features

### Fixed navigation and footer bars

The site will include a navigation bar, which will include links to the other main pages of the website - home, projects, blog, and CV - on each page. This will enable users to easily navigate the site without needing to scroll to the top of the page when they wish to access different areas of the site.

A footer bar will be included with links to personal accounts - LinkedIn, Github, and email. This will allow visitors to view additional information such as technology projects and to get in contact with me if they wish.

Both the navigation and footer bar will be fixed on the screen. The navigation bar will be fixed at the top and the footer will be fixed at the bottom of the viewport so they are always visible as the visitors scrolls.


### CV download

Visitors to the website will have the ability to download a PDF copy of my CV. This will allow them to incorporate my information into their file systems or show other relevant persons without needing to visit the website repeatedly.

# Sitemap

The website simply has all pages link to each other via the navigation bar. As more pages are added, for example when more projects are added, each will be moved to their own page. However, given the fact that the website only has four pages, it is feasible for each page to link to each other page.

# Target audience

The target audience for the website falls into two categories, which may overlap:

1. Employers
2. Project Leads

The website is intended as a showcase of my abilities as a software developer and designer. The most likely use of the website is to link alongside a traditional application for employment as evidence of ability. Additionally, employers or those leading other projects may chance upon the website and consider me for employment or inclusion in their projects.

# Tech stack
The website uses primarily HTML and CSS.

HTML is used for the content of all webpages

CSS is used for the styling and positioning of elements.

# Project Management

Trello was used to track the progress of tasks within the project. A series of screenshots representing a timeline of the project is provided below.
